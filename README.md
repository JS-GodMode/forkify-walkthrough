# Forkify üç≤

Forkify is a recipe web application built with **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, bundled with **Parcel** for a streamlined development experience. This project is designed to provide in-depth practice with JavaScript fundamentals, setting a solid foundation for understanding its applications in frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular. Forkify connects to an API by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://x.com/jonasschmedtman), allowing users to search, view, and add recipes with real-time updates and feedback.

## Overview

Forkify offers a dynamic recipe browsing experience with the following features:

- **Search Recipes**: Find recipes with ease from a vast API database.
- **View and Scale Recipes**: Display recipe details, adjust servings, and update ingredient quantities.
- **Custom Recipes**: Add new recipes to personalize the library.
- **Error and Success Feedback**: Real-time messaging to improve user interactions.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices.

## Project Motivation

Forkify is a hands-on project to dive deep into JavaScript, applying core programming concepts and preparing for advanced frameworks. This project is a comprehensive practice ground for foundational JS principles, API integration, and the use of modern bundlers like Parcel.

## Features

### Version 2.4 Updates

1.  **Search Functionality**

    - Users can search recipes by keyword, with results fetched from the API.
    - A loading spinner provides feedback during load times, and clear error messages notify users when searches don't return results.

2.  **Enhanced User Feedback**

    - Error and success messages provide real-time responses, improving user experience.

3.  **File Structure Improvements**

    - A `View.js` parent file organizes common view functionalities, enhancing code modularity and maintainability.

### Previous Versions Highlights

- **MVC Architecture**: Modular architecture based on the Model-View-Controller pattern.
- **Publisher-Subscriber Pattern**: Supports loose coupling and clear data flow within the MVC framework.
- **Helper and Config Files**: Centralized utility functions and configuration settings for easy maintenance.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and semantics.
- **CSS3**: Styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core functionality and logic.
- **Parcel**: Bundler for optimized builds and development.
- **API**: Forkify API by Jonas Schmedtmann.
